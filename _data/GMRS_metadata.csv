朝廷從其議","In the time of Emperor Wu of the Jin 晉武帝 (founder of Jin 晉dynasty, r. 265-290), He Jian Prefecture was home to a couple who secretly fell in love and accordingly promised each other in marriage.
Following this, the man was conscripted into the army and for many years did not return.
The girl’s family increasingly desired to marry her off to another suitor but she refused to go along with this.
Her parents forced her, and, with no other options, she was sent off. In short time, [however,] she became sick and passed away. Thereupon, the man returned from guarding the frontier garrison and inquired the whereabouts of the girl.
The family explained it all to him [and] he thereafter came to the tomb in order to express his grief for her, at which point he was so overcome with emotion that he then [burst] open the tomb and unsealed the coffin.
Immediately the girl came back to life, and he carried her home. The man helped her recuperate and within a few days she was healed just as she was before.
Later, [her] husband , upon hearing this, thereupon came to retrieve her, but the man would not give her back, saying:
« Your wife, sir, has died. Where in the world as one heard of a dead person who could be brought back to life? This [woman] was bestowed upon me by Heaven; [she] is not your wife. » Accordingly, they brought the matter to court, but the regional court could not render a verdict and sent the case to be considered at the Commandant of Justice , where the secretary of that office, Wang Dao , memorialized the throne as follows:
«Pure commitment achieved to the utmost, is reciprocated by Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the occurrence of death and subsequent resurrection is such an extraordinary event that it cannot be judged with ordinary li . It is requested that she be returned to the one who opened the tomb. »

荼蘼粥
舊辱趙東岩雲子瑻夫寄詩，中有一詩云「好春虛度三之一，滿架荼蘼取次開。有客相看無可設，數枝帶雨剪將來」。始疑荼蘼非可食者。一日，過靈鷲，訪僧蘋洲德修。午留粥，甚香美，詢之，乃蘼花也。其法采花片，同甘草湯焯，候粥熟同煮。又采木香嫩葉，就元湯，炒以薑、油、鹽為菜茹。僧苦嗜吟宜乎。知此味之清，且知岩雲之詩不誣也。

Pick white pebbles from a clear stream. One can also use those with moss. Take ten or twenty. Draw some spring water to boil them. The flavor is more luscious than snails and faintly embraces the savor of spring pebbles. This recipe is inspired from Wu Jigao, and I say: “Although these are not pebbles that are boiled throughout a night for food, their charm is eminently pure.”
Tumi Flower Porridge
In the past, I was honored to receive Zhao Dongyan’s poems. There is one that says “Whiling away a third of the pleasurable spring, tumi flowers fill the railings, blossoming in succession. A guest came to visit; having nothing to offer, I snapped in rain a few twigs wet with rain.” Initially I doubted that tumi were edible. One day, I went past the Numinous Vulture Monastery and visited the monk Dexiu in Pinzhou. At noon he invited me to have some porridge. It was very aromatic and delicious, so I asked about it. It was tumi blossoms. The cooking method is to pick the petals, blanch them in liquorice broth, and boil them along with porridge once it is ready. One may also pick fresh leaves of costus root to go with the original broth and stir-fry them with ginger, oil, and salt as vegetables to eat. Monks are earnestly keen on celebrating that the dish is agreeable. Now I know the purity of such flavor and that Yanyun’s poem is not unfounded.
Yuanxiu Plant
Su Shi has a poem “Yuanxiu Sprouts from My Old Friend Chao.” Whenever I read the line “The legumes round and small, the locust sprouts slender and abundant,” I always search for the mystery among the fields and must seek to attain its truth. I often ask elder gardeners, but few can talk about it. One day, a local of Yongjia (in Zhejiang Province), Zheng Wen’gan, came from the Shu area (in Sichuan Province) and went past the Plum Town. I asked him about it, and he replied: these are broad beans, also commonly named peas. Shu people call them Chao sprouts. Their sprouts and leaves are tender and can often be picked as vegetables. Pick and clean them, stir-fry them in hot sesame oil, and then boil them with soy sauce and salt. When the spring ends, the sprouts and leaves grow rough and cannot be eaten. What Su Shi means by “A drop of wine to accompany fermented beans, a piece of orange to blend with ginger and scallion” is indeed the method of cooking. A nobleman is ashamed when there is one thing that he does not know. He ought to travel long and far. Only after then can his knowledge be broadened. I have been reading Su Shi’s poem for twenty years and one day I have finally come to understand it. My rapture is imaginable.",,,,,,,,,,item,,,

The old man of True Heart lives abstinently and leisurely and entertains himself with the Classic of Changes. He faces the Vast Hill Censer, paper canopy with plums, tea leaves in stoneware, and his daily supplies are simple. One time there were guests coming from another land, who all day long engaged in profound discussions and each had the look of hunger. I called the servant boys to offer vegetarian delicacies. The guests tasted them, said that they emanated no smell of the humane world, and asked for recipes. I delivered orally twenty pieces, each with a eulogy of sixteen characters to accompany those of rich flavor.
Sipping Legumes. Shu refers to soybeans. Slice tofu into strips and plainly boil them. Dip them with the Five Flavors.
Does the Rites not say it? Sip soybean and drink water. Plain silk for variegated colors, deep and pellucid.
Roasted taro. Roast taro till aromatic and cut into slices. 
Three in the morning and four at night, what is the monkey keeper doing? Turning down your lamb, I taste my taro.
Postscript
For the above twenty entrees, there is no need to prepare all of them. If you can have one fourth of them, it will be sufficient. The first five entrees derive from the classics. That I display them on the forefront of the feast is to venerate the classics. As for the remaining fifteen entrees, if you have them, then prepare them, if not, then forgo. One might have a drink and exchange toasts, express without inhibition deep longings, but not get intoxicated for the fear of rendering the gathering uncouth. Odes sings about picking duckweed, and Rites reveres plant sacrifice. The vegetation along creeks, brooks, ponds, and pools can be presented to kings and lords and offered to ghosts and spirits.  If one treats guests with them, who will say that it is improper? Though I cannot avoid lending myself to the derision of those who make duke’s meal and fish stew, if it were not laughed at, it would not be regarded as the Way. They laugh at me, and I laugh at them. My guests take their leave from the door with great laughter, and I come back to my stand also with laughter. Once my hands finished recording this I again laughed at myself. My eyes read through it and then I laugh yet again. If this treatise chanced to be scattered in the human world and this generation circulated it, the laughter would see no end.",,,,,,,,,,item,,,

At that time there was a foolish man who, seeing how he was like this, said to the people that he was his brother. The reason for he called him his brother because he had a lot of money and when you need money then you could use it, this was the reason why he called him brother. When the foolish man saw this wealthy man asking him to pay the debt, he said the wealthy man was not his brother.
The bystanders said to him, ""You are a foolish man, how can you say that he is your brother when you need to use money, and when he wants you to pay the debt, you also say that he is not your brother?""
The foolish man replied and said, ""It was because I wanted to get his money that I recognized him as my brother, but in fact he was not my brother. As for the time when the debt was demanded, I said that he was not my brother.""
When people heard these words, there was no one who did not tease him. This is just like some heretics who, hearing the Buddha's excellent teaching in his sayings, plagiarize the Buddha's sayings to use, as them as their own words. When the bystanders ask him to cultivate themselves in a right practice these with these theories, they are unwilling to practice and said these words, ""In order to get offerings, I took some of the Buddha's sayings to cultivate and guide all living creatures, but in fact I do not really believe in the Buddha's words, so how can I practice in the right way according to them?"" Just like the foolish man mentioned above, in order to get some money, he says that the rich man is his brother; and when he is forced to pay a debt, he says that he is not his brother.

He brought the agalwood back to his home and went to the market to try to sell it, but because of the high price, there was no buyer in the end. After many days, it was still unsold, and he was tired and bored, and distressed by the lack of sales. When he saw someone selling charcoal, it was quickly sold out, so he raised some thoughts and said to himself, ""Why not burn the agalwood into charcoal, and it will be sold quickly."" At that moment he burned them into charcoal and took them to the market to sell them, but the money he got from the sale was less than the value of half a cart of charcoal.
Some foolish man in the world are in the same way. There are infinite expedient approaches to practice, and if they practice diligently and courageously, hoping to attain the Buddha's fruit (Buddha Pala), and because the Buddha's fruit is difficult to attain, they develop a retreating mind and think, ""It would be better to develop the mind and seek the Hinayana hearer position, so that they can quickly cut off birth and death and attain the fruit of Arahantship.""",,,,,,,,,,item,,,

The dwelling places and sources of food and drink of the Yi and Di follow the movements of the water and grass, shifting with the seasons. They have lords, elders, and tribal names, but they are without lineages or written records. As for the bow and the poisoned arrow, the conquest of the strong and weak, the size of the state’s land, and the instability of their rise and fall; how are these worth investigating and compiling? Only their compliance and rebellion, their advance and retreat, and those actions which benefit or harm the central state are what must be known. From the time of the ancients, the relation of the Yi and Di to the central state was such that when [the central plain] was in accordance with the Way, they did not necessarily comply; and when [the central plain] was not in accordance with the Way, they did not necessarily stay away. This was probably related to their own decline and flourishing. Even though they are situated outside of the governance [of the central plain], they cannot be neglected from the perspective of control and manipulation. Our understanding of them is not necessarily for our benefit, but losing them is enough to cause us harm. Can we afford to not be attentive! Thusly, I composed the “Appendix of the Barbarians of the Four Directions.” ¶ There are numerous names for the Yi and Di. The larger groups are well-known in the central states, but the smaller and more distant ones are only marginally known, and the ones beyond those are not even worth recording—their names are beyond number. Their territories surround the limits of the Nine Regions,[1] and the northwest tends to be strong, often causing problems for the central plain. In the times of Xia, Shang, and Zhou, the Xianyun[2] are seen in the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents. Since the time of Qin and Han, the Xiongnu[3] were famous.

Just as this fool, who wanted to praise his father, spoke in error and it was thus.",,,,,,,,,,item,,,

In former times there was a foolish man who arrived at someone’s house. The host invited him for dinner, but he disliked the food, finding it bland and tasteless. The host listened and added salt. As he was pleased with the salt, he said to himself: « It is the salt that makes it good. If it is like this with little, how much better would it be with even more? » The foolish man lacked sense and began to fill up on salt. He ate it up until his mouth became numb, making him miserable. This is like those outside the Way, who hearing that abstinence/fasting can help one obtain the Way, thereafter abstains from eating (and drinking?). Some last seven days, some fifteen, suffering from hunger in vain, all without reaching the Way. Like the foolish man who thought salt good and ate it by itself until his mouth was numb, it shall be thus.",,,,,,,,,,item,,,
