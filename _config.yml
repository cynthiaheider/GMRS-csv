description: The Global Medieval and Early Modern Digital Library is an initiative of the Program in Global Medieval and Renaissance Studies (GMRS) at the University of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with Penn Libraries. The Digital Library brings together translations, often accompanied by transcriptions, of primary sources encompassing a wide range of genres, regions and languages from the period between Late Antiquity and 1700. The site allows these sources to be organized by theme, region, language and date. We hope it is a useful resource for scholars and students and will facilitate global research in premodern studies.
